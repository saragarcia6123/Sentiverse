# Sentiverse ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•

## A full-stack web application for analyzing the emotional landscape of your favorite song lyrics

Sentiverse searches for your favorite songs on [Genius](https://genius.com), retrieves the lyrics, and classifies them based on emotionally opposite word pairs.

Its core aim is to enhance the way we connect with music by revealing at a glance the underlying emotions that resonate within the lyrics.

## How it works

1) The user submits a song and artist query to the API
2) A list of matching results is returned by the API
3) The user selects the matching song
4) The API fetches the lyrics for the given song by scraping them with [BeautifulSoup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io)
5) The lyrics are cleaned and preprocessed
6) Facebook's pre-trained model [RoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/roberta-large-mnli) tokenizes and classifies the lyrics pair-by-pair according to the pre-defined labels (such as ['HAPPY', 'SAD'])
7) The scores for each pair sum up to 1.0, which are displayed in the Front-end as a diverging bar chart
